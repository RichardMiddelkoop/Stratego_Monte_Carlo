"""Internal State Breakdown:
shape = (layers, rows, columns)

state layers are defined by name in the StateLayers enum.

layers:
0: player 1 ground truth pieces (contents are SP enum types and CAN'T be UNKNOWN)
1: player 2 ground truth pieces (contents are SP enum types and CANT'T be UNKNOWN)
2: obstacle map (contents are 1 for 'obstacle at this space', 0 otherwise)

3: player 1 pieces from player 2's partially observable perspective (contents are SP enum types and CAN be UNKNOWN)
4: player 2 pieces from player 1's partially observable perspective (contents are SP enum types and CAN be UNKNOWN)

5: scalar data...
    state[3,0,0]: turn count (initial turn when no player has moved is 0, increments by 1 with each player action)
    state[3,0,1]: whether game is over (0 for False, 1 for True)
    state[3,0,2]: winner of the game if the game is over (0 for tie, 1 for player 1 won, -1 for player 2 won) (meaningless if game isn't over)
    state[3,1,0]: max turn count (after this many turns have happened, game is over and tied. We may or may not consider this kind of ending as invalid)
    state[3,1,1]: whether the game ending can be considered invalid (0 for False, 1 for True) (meaningless if game isn't over)

6: player 1 recent moves map for enforcing 2-squares rule against oscillating pieces back and forth (contents are RecentMoves enum types)
    This layer (and thus move tracking) is wiped to zeros anytime player 1 makes an attack.
    (0 for no move made here recently)
    (1 for the most recent piece to move came from here)
    (-1 for the most recent piece to move is now here)
    (-2 for the most recent piece to move is now here, and this is also the spot that it was in 2 turns ago.
       This piece cannot go to a spot marked as 1 and then return here.
    (-3 for the most recent piece to move is now here, and this is also the spot that it was in 2 turns ago.
       This piece cannot double back again (The piece here can't go to a spot marked with 1).

7: player 2 recent moves map (same rules apply)

8-19: player 1 captured pieces maps. Each piece is its own layer. (Layers are identified by _get_player_captured_piece_layer)
    These pieces were owned by player 1 but captured (and type revealed) by player 2.
    (0 for no piece of this type was ever captured at this location)
    (1 for 1 piece of the this type was captured at this location)
    (2 for 2 pieces of this type were captured at this location)
    etc.

20-31: player 2 captured pieces maps (same rules apply) (Layers are identified by _get_player_captured_piece_layer)

32: player 1 still pieces (from player 2's perspective), 1 for piece here that has never moved, 0 otherwise
33: player 2 still pieces (from player 1's perspective), 1 for piece here that has never moved, 0 otherwise
